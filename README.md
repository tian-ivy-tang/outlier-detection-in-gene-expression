# Fast & Sensitive Outlier Detection in Gene Expression for Rare Disease Diagnosis
## ML & statistical model implementation and benchmarking



## Project Objective
This project benchmarks machine learning and statistical methods for outlier detection in high-dimensional gene expression datasets, with the goal of supporting rare disease  diagnosis and treatment.

**Challenge: presence of unknown confounding factor in high-dimensional datasets.** Single gene expression can be influence by many factors such as geneder, race, hereditary diseases, almost all of which are unknown from the datasets. Gene expression can also be impacted by neighboring genes (individually or in group).

## Methodology
- Applied machine learning and statistical models for outlier detection and dimensionality reduction in genomic datasets.
- Evaluated model performance based on:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Consistency
  - Computational efficiency

## Model selection
tbc.

## Project files
- R and Python cripts for model implementation + csv output files + plotting scripts for benchmarking comparison
- Final report summarizing methodology, benchmarking results, and insights
